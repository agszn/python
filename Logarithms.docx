Logarithms are mathematical operations that help us solve equations involving exponential growth or decay. They are the inverse operations of exponentiation. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the basics:

### Definition

If \( b^x = y \), then \( \log_b(y) = x \), where:
- \( b \) is the base of the logarithm,
- \( y \) is the number you're taking the logarithm of,
- \( x \) is the exponent to which the base must be raised to obtain \( y \).

### Common Bases

1. **Base 10 (Common Logarithm)**: \( \log_{10}(y) \) is often written as \( \log(y) \). For example, \( \log(100) = 2 \) because \( 10^2 = 100 \).

2. **Base \( e \) (Natural Logarithm)**: \( \log_e(y) \) is written as \( \ln(y) \). Here, \( e \approx 2.71828 \). For example, \( \ln(e^2) = 2 \) because \( e^2 = e^2 \).

3. **Base 2 (Binary Logarithm)**: \( \log_2(y) \) is used in computer science, particularly in algorithms and information theory. For example, \( \log_2(8) = 3 \) because \( 2^3 = 8 \).

### Properties of Logarithms

1. **Product Rule**: \( \log_b(x \cdot y) = \log_b(x) + \log_b(y) \)
   - Example: \( \log_10(100 \cdot 10) = \log_10(100) + \log_10(10) = 2 + 1 = 3 \)

2. **Quotient Rule**: \( \log_b\left(\frac{x}{y}\right) = \log_b(x) - \log_b(y) \)
   - Example: \( \log_10\left(\frac{100}{10}\right) = \log_10(100) - \log_10(10) = 2 - 1 = 1 \)

3. **Power Rule**: \( \log_b(x^n) = n \cdot \log_b(x) \)
   - Example: \( \log_10(100^2) = 2 \cdot \log_10(100) = 2 \cdot 2 = 4 \)

4. **Change of Base Formula**: \( \log_b(x) = \frac{\log_k(x)}{\log_k(b)} \)
   - Example: To convert \( \log_2(8) \) to base 10: \( \log_2(8) = \frac{\log_{10}(8)}{\log_{10}(2)} \approx \frac{0.903}{0.301} = 3 \)

### Examples of Logarithms in Python

You can use Python's `math` module to compute logarithms:

```python
import math

# Common logarithm (base 10)
print(math.log10(100))  # Output: 2.0

# Natural logarithm (base e)
print(math.log(math.e ** 2))  # Output: 2.0

# Binary logarithm (base 2)
print(math.log2(8))  # Output: 3.0

# Change of base formula
base_10_log = math.log10(8)
base_2_log = base_10_log / math.log10(2)
print(base_2_log)  # Output: 3.0
```

### Applications

- **Algorithms**: Logarithms are used to analyze the time complexity of algorithms (e.g., binary search).
- **Computer Science**: Binary logarithms are used in data structures like heaps and trees.
- **Finance**: Logarithms are used in calculations involving exponential growth, such as compound interest.
- **Statistics**: Logarithms are used to transform data for various statistical analyses.
