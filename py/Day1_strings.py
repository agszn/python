#Strings
#Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.
#
#'hello' is the same as "hello".
#
#You can display a string literal with the print() function:

'''
Assign String to a Variable
Multiline Strings 
a = """ lorem ipsum dolor sit 
amet"""
'''
a = "Hello, World!"
print(a[1])
a = "Hello, World!"
print(len(a))
txt = "The best things in life are free!"
print("free" in txt)
