Using loops in Python automates and repeats the tasks in an efficient manner. 
But sometimes, there may arise a condition where you want to exit the loop completely, 
skip an iteration or ignore that condition. These can be done by loop control statements. 
Loop control statements change execution from their normal sequence. When execution leaves a scope, 
all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed. 

Python supports the following control statements:

Break statement
Continue statement
Pass statement
